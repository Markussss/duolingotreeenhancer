# Duolingo Tree Enhancer

User script for a better experience when using Duolingo.

### What does it do?

The following options are available:

1. Keep per-tree settings for listening/speaking exercises.
2. Make all the exercises listening exercises (hide the question).
3. Read answers aloud.
4. Hide clues (i.e. pictures).
4. Make Duo better for reverse trees.

### DuolingoTreeEnhancer stopped working, HELP!

Duolingo is constantly making small changes and tweaks in the website. When it happens there are two options:

1. If you are a developer and can fix the problem yourself, please submit a patch.
2. Otherwise, be patient. I'll work on it as soon as possible.
